Welcome to ToLearnKorean.com, glad to see you here.

On this website I want to teach you the Korean language.  

Each unit is divided into multiple chapters. Each chapter focusses on one topic. I aim to make each chapter precise, high in quality and as easy as it can be.  
Learning Korean can sometimes get hard or intimidating. But it can also be fun and rewarding. My goal is to aim for the later!

This unit introduces you to the whole Korean alphabet, also called Hangul. Hangul is easier to learn than you might expect.  
If you already know how to read Hangul you might be interested in starting with [Unit 2](/overview#unit-2), which is all about creating your first complete sentences.

To get started on learning the Korean alphabet click the *Next Chapter* button down below, this will take you to the next chapter.
