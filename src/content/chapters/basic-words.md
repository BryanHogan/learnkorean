Congratulation! You can now read Hangul!

These are all letters of the Korean alphabet in order:  
ㄱ,ㄲ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄸ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅇ, ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ,
ㅏ, ㅐ, ㅑ, ㅒ, ㅓ, ㅔ, ㅕ, ㅖ, ㅗ, ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, ㅠ, ㅡ, ㅢ, ㅣ

I made a [Hangul Anki deck for you]((/files/ToLearnKoreanHangul.apkg)) with which you can practice and memorize all letters of Hangul.

With this knowledge you can now read any word in Korean. So let's cover some basic words.

| Korean | English                   |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| 안녕하세요  | Hello                     |
| 네      | Yes                       |
| 아니요    | No                        |
| 감사합니다  | Thank you                 |
| 여기     | Here                      |
| 저기     | There                     |
| 괜찮아요   | It's okay / Are you okay? |
| 사람     | Person                    |
| 이름     | Name                      |
| 이거     | This                      |
| 저     | I, me (formal)                    |
| 나     | I, me (informal)                     |
| 이다     | to be                     |

These are words you can encounter frequently in Korea.

Verbs like "이다" are conjugated when used in sentences, the form shown here is the base form. Their conjugation changes depending on formality and time form (tense). More on this in unit 2.

Once you feel somewhat comfortable with reading Korean letters I recommend you to study vocabulary with this <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917" target="_blank">first 500 words pre-made deck by TTMIK</a>. Each word here has audio included, this is not only great for learning the word but also understanding the pronunciation.
