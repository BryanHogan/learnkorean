Welcome to tolearnkorean.com, glad to see you here.

If you already know how to read Hangul (한글) then you can skip this chapter.

A great introduction into the Hangul, the Korean alphabet, is [Billy Go's Video](#).  
Being able to read Hangul doesn't take long. There's only about as many different "letters" as in the English language. It is not possible to represent Korean words with letters of another language. Understanding Hangul is the fundamental first step to mastering Korean.

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.
