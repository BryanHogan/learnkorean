##  Further resources
Further resources that will be helpful to you now:
- There are some sound change rules which are really helpful to know. I would suggest watching [this video by BillyGo](https://youtu.be/s5aobqyEaMQ?t=3690) on the Korean sound change rules. I wouldn't suggest adding these into a flashcard deck yet as you will come across these naturally on your learning journey, so just hearing about them once for now should be enough.
- [How to pronunce 의](https://youtu.be/2bLlrXDZ478) by BillyGo.
- Get this Anki deck: [TTMIK's First 500 Korean Words by Retro](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1551455917). It includes mostly relevant Korean words with pictures and audio for their pronunciation.
