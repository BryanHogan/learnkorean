## All Consonants
There are more consonants in Hangul. Luckily they are similar to characters we have already learned.

Strong Consonants:
- ㅊ = ch
- ㅋ = k
- ㅌ = t
- ㅍ = p

Double Consonants:
- ㄲ
- ㄸ
- ㅃ
- ㅆ
- ㅉ

So these are all consonants in Hangul: ㄱ, ㄲ,ㄴ, ㄷ, ㄸ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅇ, ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ
