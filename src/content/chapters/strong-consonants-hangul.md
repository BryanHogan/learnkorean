About the four strong consonants of Hangul.

## Strong consonants
There are more consonants in Hangul. Luckily they are similar to characters we have already learned. Korean has the following strong consonants: ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ

These strong consonants might seem familiar to you. They are all made by adding one stroke to their plain version, except for ㅂ.
- ㅈ: ㅊ
- ㄱ: ㅋ
- ㄷ: ㅌ
- ㅂ: ㅍ

These strong consonants are pronounced with more force and a higher pitch. They are also often called aspirated consonants, since more air leaves your mouth when you pronounce them.

- ㅊ = "ch"
- ㅋ = "k"
- ㅌ = "t"
- ㅍ = "p"

ㅊ has a strong and higher pitched "ch" sound, compared to the plain "ㅈ" which is less strong and lower in pitch.  
ㅋ sounds more like a "k", compared to "ㄱ" which is more of a mix of between "k/g".  
ㅌ sounds more like a "t", compared to "ㄷ" which is more of a mix of between "d/t".  
ㅍ sounds more like a "p", compared to "ㅂ" which is more of a mix of between "b/p".
